- Do not commit .env, tokens, node_modules, or build output.
- Use semantic HTML suitable for Nepali localization.

## Revised Product Direction

nepali.no is a Nepali-first, but not Nepali-only, nonprofit and public-benefit platform for the Nepali community in Norway.

Important audiences include:
- Nepali-speaking residents in Norway
- Young Nepali Norwegians who may prefer Norwegian
- Students, families, volunteers, and community organizations
- Norwegian public agencies, NGOs, partners, and potential funders

A major platform pillar will be reliable, understandable guidance based on official information from agencies such as UDI, Skatteetaten, NAV, Helsenorge, municipalities, and other public bodies. nepali.no must explain and contextualize information while linking users to the current official source. The platform must not present itself as a government agency or replace official legal, tax, immigration, health, or welfare guidance.

## Important Development Practice

For Astro, HTML, and other substantial code, provide downloadable .txt files instead of rendered chat code blocks. The chat renderer has previously removed opening HTML tags and corrupted Astro markup.

## Next Work

- Review, stage, commit, and push the multilingual News routing milestone.
- Design a Public Information Guide content model with official-source and review-date controls.
- Decide how language and optional translations should apply to Public Information Guides, Community Events, and Business Listings.
- Continue one verified step at a time.

## Public Information Guide Foundation Checkpoint

Completed and validated:
- Added sanity/schemaTypes/publicInformationGuide.ts.
- Registered Public Information Guide in sanity/schemaTypes/index.ts.
- Added Nepali and Norwegian Bokmal language support with an optional linked translation.
- Added topic and intended-audience fields.
- Added rich guide content with accessible images.
- Added responsible public agency and required primary official HTTPS source.
- Added additional official links and explanations of important Norwegian terms.
- Added editorial reviewer, publication date, last-reviewed date, and next-review date.
- Added draft, active, needs-review, and archived workflow statuses.
- Added featured, urgent, and optional funding or partner acknowledgement fields.
- Added five GROQ queries for active, featured, urgent, individual, and overdue-review guides.
- Validated active-guide and overdue-review GROQ expressions directly against the Sanity production dataset.
- Sanity Studio build passed for all four registered document types.
- Astro check passed with 0 errors and 0 warnings.
- Astro production build passed and generated /, /ne/news/, and /nb/news/.

## Next Work

- Create multilingual interface labels and routes for the public-information section.
- Decide the public URL terminology for Nepali and Norwegian routes.

- The archive fetches active guides using ACTIVE_PUBLIC_INFORMATION_GUIDES_QUERY and the route language.
- The archive displays responsible agencies, official-source links, last-reviewed dates, next-review dates, urgent and featured labels, and localized empty states.
- Astro check passed with 0 errors and 0 warnings.
- Astro production build passed and generated five pages: /, /ne/news/, /nb/news/, /ne/info/, and /nb/info/.
